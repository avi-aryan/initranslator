<dt>What are keywords to preserve ? </dt>
<dd>The words or phrases which you dont want to be translated by the program ( which actually depends on Google Translate ) . <br>
	For example if you have some text like 'window' or 'class' in your translation file, you don't want it to be translated as it is a 
	techincal word and will make no sense when translated. <br>
	So you will list them one by one and they wont be translated.</dd>

<br><br>

<dt>Using other files with this tool </dt>
<dd>Ini Translator can be used to translate any files that store text / data in the format <code>key = value</code>. </dd>

<br><br>

<dt>Resizing the Ini Translator GUI </dt>
<dd> Although, Ini Translator auto-resizes with the screen dimensions, you can resize the window yourself by changing the two IniTranslator.ini 
	keys <code>w_intofactor</code> and <code>h_intofactor</code> . <br>
	By default these values are 1 which means IniT is enlarged to 1x times of the auto-selected width and heights . So , selecting <code>w_intofactor
	</code> as 1.5 will make IniT enlarge to 1.5 times of the auto-selected width .

<dt>remove_ampersand - Remove & in translations </dt>
<dd>Many programs use &key combinations which helps creates Alt+key shortcuts for fast and convenient user access. <br>However, these English alphabet 
	keys may be unavailable in other keyboards and so this option has been provided to completely remove & from translations. <br>
	Setting it to 0 will not remove &.

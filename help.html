<dt>What are keywords to preserve ? </dt>
<dd>The words or phrases which you dont want to be translated by the program ( which actually depends on Google Translate ) . <br>
	For example if you have some text like 'window' or 'class' in your translation file, you don't want it to be translated as it is a 
	techincal word and will make no sense when translated. <br>
	So you will list them one by one and they wont be translated.</dd>

<br><br>

<dt>Using other files with this tool </dt>
<dd>Ini Translator can be used to translate any files that store text / data in the format <code>key = value</code>. </dd>

<br><br>

<dt>Resizing the Ini Translator GUI </dt>
<dd> Although, Ini Translator auto-resizes with the screen dimensions, you can resize the window yourself by changing the two IniTranslator.ini 
	keys <code>w_intofactor</code> and <code>h_intofactor</code> . <br>
	By default these values are 1 which means IniT is enlarged to 1x times of the auto-selected width and heights . So , selecting <code>w_intofactor
	</code> as 1.5 will make IniT enlarge to 1.5 times of the auto-selected width .

<dt>remove_ampersand - Remove & in translations </dt>
<dd>Many programs use &key combinations which helps creates Alt+key shortcuts for fast and convenient user access. <br>However, these English alphabet 
	keys may be unavailable in other keyboards and so this option has been provided to completely remove & from translations. <br>
	Setting it to 0 will not remove &.
</dd>

<br><br>

<dt>Achieving maximum possible accuracy with the tool </dt>
<dd>Use the 'keywords to preserve' feature to list words that you don't want to be translated. A very practical way to do this can be going through the language file 
you are favourable with and then choosing words that you think have meanings different than what they are here. Those words/phrases can be listed in the provided space to 
not translate if they are found.
